## Observations (GN):

Various experiments with the full-length video (35 mins) augmented with subtitles.
Using Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct.

Tried various prompts. Including:

* the one I used to compare with other models.
* the one used by PI on Gemini (see repetitive loop in the answer)
* variants of that (see repetitive loop in the answer)
* and the final prompt is crafted to stay high level and get better descriptions

### Main take-aways

1. Qwen can do a good job on 35mins video IF the descriptions are brief and segment coarse
2. Asking for more details (description or more granular segments) will lead to repetitive loops
3. This shouldn't be an issue on shorter videos (below 20 mins), so a two passes approach may work well
4. See last response for a more promising example of high-level segmentation

PROMPT:

The video is a broadcast television recording. List all the high-level segments in the video. Don't be too granular. A segment length can vary between 2 and 30 minutes. They are usually clearly separated by blank or count down screens. Answer as a JSON array with starting time, any text in the separation screen preceding the segment, and a few words describing the content of teh segment.

PROMPT:

The video is a broadcast television recording. Analyse the video. First, identify from the text in the title plate(s), ident(s), or transmission card(s), how many programmes are in this recording, and any relevant metadata about the programmes, including network, name, channel, and transmission date if available. Then break down each programme into meaningful segments, for example, if it is a news programme identify each of the news stories. Output an index of the segments with a timestamp and a detailed summary of each segment, focusing on subjects, places and actions, and including any relevant information from the visuals, sound, text or speech. Return this index as a valid JSON array.

PROMPT:

The video is a broadcast television recording. Analyse the video. First, identify from the text in the title plate(s), ident(s), or transmission card(s), how many programmes are in this recording, and any relevant metadata about the programmes, including network, name, channel, and transmission date if available. Then break down each programme into meaningful segments, for example, if it is a news programme identify each of the news stories. Output an index of the segments with a timestamp and a short summary (one short sentence maximum) of each segment, focusing on subjects, places and actions, and including any relevant information from the visuals, texts and subtitles. Return this index as a valid JSON array.
